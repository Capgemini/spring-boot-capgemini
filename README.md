# Spring Boot - Capgemini

Spring Boot Capgemini includes a number of Spring Boot Starters that we have found useful whilst building real world Spring Boot applications at Capgemini.

Some of the Starters are integrations to technologies not currently provided out-of-the-box by Spring Boot, and are unlikley to ever be.  Some may naturally fit as core featues and will hopefully one day be subsumed by the core project.  Others are just features we have found useful and hopefully you will too.
